# A project by Raymond and Ye for Microverse Trials


## Problems to fix in the HTML documentation Ye
- Each .nav-link should have an href attribute that links to its corresponding .main-section (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element with that id).

- Your Technical Documentation project should use at least one media query.

- All of your .nav-link elements should be in the #navbar.

- You should have the same number of .nav-link and .main-section elements.
